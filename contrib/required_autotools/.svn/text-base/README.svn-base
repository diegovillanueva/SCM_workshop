Echam requires some specific versions of the GNU autotools (m4, autoconf, automake, libtool), which may not be available on your system. The script setup.sh allows to easily install them.

--> Read the header of setup.sh before running.

List of potentially installed SW (if necessary, ie if your local version is older than the corresponding version below):

* m4 v1.4.17
* autoconf v2.69
* automake 1.14.1
* libtool 2.4.2

[* svn 1.6.11 <-- additional SW installed. Note that 1.6.11 is already quite old, so it is unlikely that this will be installed at all on your system.]
