This is a new major release of ECHAM6, "echam-6.3.00"
=====================================================

INSTALLATION
------------

ECHAM6 is doing IO for the initial and restart files based on UCAR's 
netCDF (see http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf).  Take care 
that you use the right setup for your Fortran compiler when installing 
netCDF.

Configuration files for a number of operating systems and/or compilers
are provided in the config directory. Please check your system's
configuration file and edit it according to your needs.

In the machine specific mh-'file' you have to set the variable NETCDFROOT 
to the netCDF root directory on your machine.

For use of the parallelized version you have to set the MPIROOT path
and the MPI-LIB libary information in the respective mh-'file' which enables a 
compilation with MPI.

For postprocessing of the ECHAM6 code you need the afterburner software
package. For dokumentation and download of the latest revision see
https://code.zmaw.de/projects/afterburner
In case of questions contact Uwe Schulzweida (uwe.schulzweida@mpimet.mpg.de).


COMPILING AND RUNNING
---------------------

To compile and run echam6, and to generate overview plots for your results,
cd to 'run' and follow the instructions given in 'README.txt'.

Also see the comprehensive information on the usage of echam6 in
'doc/echam/echam6_userguide.pdf'


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
----------------------

Bug reports/info/comments to: monika.esch@mpimet.mpg.de

Fitness of the code
-------------------
echam-6.3.00 contains the ECHAM6 atmospheric model and the JSBACH land vegetation model.

echam-6.3.00 has been tested to compile and run on "blizzard" (xlf13.1.0.8) and "thunder" 
(intel) at DKRZ.  Tests on the PC (parallel, nproma, rerun, submodel off) were passed.

ECHAM6 has been used at two resolutions:
- T63L47 in the AMIP-LR configuration
- T31L31 in AMIP configuration
Model has also been run in coupled mode (T63L47/GR15L40).

Changes with respect to version "echam-6.2.01"
-----------------------------------------------------------
- Merge of parallel I/O.
- Several bugfixes.
- Add lines concerning Copyright/License-Agreement to all echam routines.
- Activate meltponds. 
- Clean up code, setting of masks for mo_surface.
- Update and clean up of scripting (incl. plotscripts).
- Add updates to do RCE experiments.
- Improvement of debug stream.
- Added energy budget calculation and moistening diagnostics.
- Move HD-Model from ECHAM to JSBACH.
- Set parameters for T63, T31 and T127.
- Add age-of-air-tracer submodel.
- Update to jsbach up to cosmos-landveg revision 7222, adding bug fixes 
  r7274 (mo_soil), r7296 (mo_dynveg) and r7303 (bug fix for echam runs with 
  yasso); but removing r6836 (changes of roughness length).
  lctlib version 6931 has to be used with these changes.
- Disabled use of OpenMP options on blizzard as model is not reliably
  reproducable with OpenMP.

Known issues
------------
- reruns are probably not correctly implemented if submodels are involved.
- In initialization runs, the first time step of mean value streams is not
  the same as the mean of instantaneous values written at every time step

Release plan
------------
- Minor patches for tuning adjustments, optimizations and scripting are
  possible.

- No further releases for ECHAM are planned.
