This is an example of a setup for echam6-hammoz (HAM only, with M7 aerosol microphysics scheme), at resolution T63L47GR15, with:

   * GFAS biomassburning (transient)
   * accmip_interpolated for most of the other sectors that are read from files (transient)
   * prescribed SOA
   * climatologic SST/SIC (present-day averaged)
