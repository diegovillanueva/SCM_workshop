This is an example of a transient setup for echam6-hammoz (HAM only, with M7 aerosol microphysics scheme), at resolution T63L31GR15, with prescribed SOA, and the following emissions inventories:

* accmip_interpolated: sectors AGR, AWB, AIRC, DOM, ENE, IND, SHIPS, SLV, TRA, WST
* accmip_maccity_biomassburning: sectors FFIRE, GFIRE (note that the scenario is hardcoded to 'historic' for these sectors)
* aerocom_II: sectors BIOGENIC (independant of modeled year, hardcoded to 2000), TERR (independant of modeled year)

tNote that this corresponds to hammoz defaults but for the FFIRE and GFIRE sectors.
