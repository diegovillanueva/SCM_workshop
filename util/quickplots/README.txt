ECHAM Quick Plots
=================

The main scripts are ``<experiment_name>.plot`` for plotting differences to
ERA Interim and ``<experiment_name>.plot_diff`` for plotting differences
between two experiments. These scripts are available after generating
ECHAM run scripts.
For details on their respective usage, please refer to the ECHAM user guide or
the comment blocks at the end of these scripts.

The NCL based visualizations require a valid .hluresfile in your home directory.
