{\CDI} is an Interface to access Climate and forecast model Data.
The interface is independent from a specific data format and has a C and Fortran API.
{\CDI} was developed for a fast and machine independent access to GRIB
and netCDF datasets with the same interface.
The local \href{http://www.mpimet.mpg.de/}{MPI-MET} data formats SERVICE, EXTRA and 
IEG are also supported.
