In general, \echam{} needs as input information on  
parameters like boundary conditions or atmospheric composition which are not prognosed or diagnosed in the model.
The aim of this chapter is to describe available external data sets. In the subsections named ``historic'' or
``scenarios'' we focus in particular on the description of those data sets used in the \echam{} simulations made for the fifth 
phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5; {\tt http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5}).
