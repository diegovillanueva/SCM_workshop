\section{Sea surface temperature and ice cover}

\subsection{Historic}

The historical sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice cover (SIC) data
are taken from  PCMDI's Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project
(status: Nov. 2009): 
\newline
{\tt http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/projects/amip/}

The basic observational data set was made available by NCAR and was constructed 
following the procedure described by \cite{hurrel2008}. More information can be
found on the given web site.

The data were downloaded as Grib files from
\newline
{\tt
  http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/projects/amip/AMIP2EXPDSN/BCS/amipobs\_dwnld.php}\newline 
and bilinearly remapped to the needed model grid. SST and SIC boundary
conditions 
for 1979 to 2008 are used for the AMIP experiment of CMIP5.

\subsection{Climatologies}

Sea surface temperature and sea ice cover climatologies for \echam{}
are based on our coupled pre--industrial
control simulations over 500~years 
for CMIP5, the so--called piControl experiments. These climatologies
have been used for the 
so-called "sstClim" experiment of CMIP5. Climatologies are derived from
three different piControl simulations resulting from different model
configurations:
\begin{itemize}
\item MPI-ESM-LR
\item MPI-ESM-MR
\item MPI-ESM-P
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Aqua planet}

For CMIP5 aqua planet simulations the climatological input files have been modified
following the requirements at

Sea ice cover has been set to zero. Sea surface temperature is constant,
symmetric about equator and zonally uniform, following the APE "Qobs" functional form:
\begin{eqnarray}
T(\phi) = 
\begin{cases}
T_0 + \Delta T_{max} \cdot (2 - \sin^{2} ( \frac{3 \phi}{2} ) - \sin^4 ( \frac{3 \phi}{2}))/2. & , |\phi| < \pi/3  \\
T_0 & \text{, otherwise (high latitudes)}
\end{cases}
\label{7.5.1}
\end{eqnarray}

where $\Delta T_{max} = 27 K$, $T_0 = 273.15 K$.
