\subsection{Input namelists in other files}

\subsubsection{Namelist {\tt mvctl}}\label{secmvctl}

For each stream in the {\tt mvstreamctl} namelist, a {\tt mvctl}
namelist has to be created. The {\tt mvctl} namelist has to be written
to a file {\tt \{namelist\}.nml} where {\tt \{namelist\}} is the name
of the respective stream. For tracers, the namelist has to be written
to {\tt tracer.nml}. See section~\ref{secmvstreamctl} also.

stream shall be written & 1,'months','first',0\\

& character & list of variables
(e.g.~meteorological variables, chemical species) for which mean
values are calculated & empty strings \\

 & integer & This variable controls the calculation
of the mean of the square of each variable in the list {\tt
  meannam}.\newline
${\tt stddev(1)} = -1$: calculate the mean square of all variables
present in {\tt meannam}\newline
${\tt stddev(i)} = 0$: Do not calculate the mean of the square of
variable ${\tt i}$ except if ${\tt stddev(1)=-1}$\newline
${\tt stddev(i)}= 1$: Calculate the mean of the square of variable
${\tt i}$ in list ${\tt meannam}$. & {\tt 0,0,...,0}\\\hline
