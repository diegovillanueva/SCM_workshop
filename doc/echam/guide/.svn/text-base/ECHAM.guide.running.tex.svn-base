The executable\index{executable echam6} is called {\tt echam6} and is put into {\tt
  echam-$<$tag\_number$>$/bin}. The actual command to call the
executable depends on the computer system. On the supercomputer
platform \blizzard{} at DKRZ, the command would be {\tt poe echam6}, on
Linux platforms you can use {\tt mpirun} in order to call a parallel
program. The {\tt echam6} command itself can take the arguments {\tt
  -i} or {\tt --init} that both have the same effect. This argument
forces an initial run and overrides any namelist setting in this respect. It is
therefore possible to use this command line option to perform a chain
job in which the subsequent calls of {\tt echam6} perform restarts
except the initial call for which the {\tt -i} or {\tt --init} option
has to be used. In such a case, the namelist for the first and
subsequent calls of {\tt echam6} can be identical although the first
call is an initial run and the subsequent calls are restarts. See
also the description of the {\tt lresume}
\index{namelist variables!lresume} namelist--variable in 
Tab.~\ref{tabrunctl}.
