\section{Horizontal diffusion\label{sec:hordif}}\label{c4}

Unlike the other physical parameterizations which are computed in grid 
point space, the horizontal diffusion can conveniently be formulated in 
spectral space. Moreover, the treatment of horizontal diffusion differs 
from that of the other processes in that it does not involve a physical 
model of subgrid-scale processes, but rather a numerically convenient form 
of scale selective diffusion with coefficients determined empirically to 
ensure a realistic behavior of the resolved scales. As in many other 
models, the horizontal diffusion tendency is expressed in the form of a 
hyper-Laplacian,

\begin{equation}
\dnd{\chi}{t}=-(-1)^qK_{\chi}\nabla^{2q}\chi	
\label{4.1}
\end{equation}

where $\chi$ is vorticity, divergence or temperature (no horizontal
diffusion is applied to water components or trace constituents),
$K_{\chi}$ is a constant diffusion coefficient for the respective
variable, and $q > 0$ is an integer. The time rate of change of
spectral component $\chi_{n}$ is given by

\begin{equation}
\dnd{\chi_{n}}{t}=-K_{\chi}\left \{n(n+1)a^{-2}\right\}^q\chi_{n}	
\label{4.2}	
\end{equation}

where $a$ is the Earth's radius and $n$ is wavenumber. For
convenience, $K_{\chi}$ can be replaced by the e-folding damping time
$\tau$ of the highest resolvable wavenumber $n_{0}$

\begin{equation}
\tau(n_{0})\equiv\tau_{0}=K_{\chi}^{-1}\left\{n_{0}(n_{0}+1)a^{-2}
	\right\}^{-q}
	\label{4.3}
\end{equation}

so that \eref{4.2} can be expressed in terms of the order of the
scheme, $2q$, and damping time $\tau_{0}$. The scale selectivity of
the scheme increases with increasing $q$. Both damping time and order
depend on the horizontal resolution. Furthermore, in order to avoid
spurious wave reflection at the upper boundary of the model, the
diffusion is enhanced in the upper layers by gradually decreasing the
order of the scheme (Table \ref{t4.1}).
