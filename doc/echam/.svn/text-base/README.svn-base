Building the documentation:

You need to have installed pdflatex and bibtex

1) Scientific documentation:

   The command 'make scidoc' builds the scientific documentation.

   'make docclean' deletes all latex generated files (*aux,*dvi,...) 
   belonging to the scientific documentation

2) Technical user guide:

   Use the command 'make guide'
   You have to confirm the model and guide version and original creation 
   date or enter new parameters. These parameters will appear in the document.
   
   'make guideclean' deletes all latex generated files (*aux,*dvi,...)
   belonging to the guide document.

3) 'make' or 'make all' creates both scientific documentation and user guide.
   'make clean' deletes all latex generated files (*aux,*dvi,...)
